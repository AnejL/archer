**What is it?**

It's an interactive post-first-boot installer for Arch based systems. Installs my personal barebones system utilities + minimal set of suckless tools (dwm + st + dmenu).

**How to run it?**

./installer.sh

**How to change it?**

However you like... It's free software so use it as you please!
