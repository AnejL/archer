**What is it?**

It's an interactive utility installer for Arch + pacman based systems. Installs my personal barebones system utilities + minimal set of suckless tools (dwm with fullgaps patch + st + dmenu).

**How to run it?**

./installer.sh

**How to change it?**

However you like... It's free software so use it as you please!

Script structure easily allows adding your own modules and modifying those existing.
