**What is it?**

It's an interactive utility installer for Arch + pacman based systems. It installs my personal barebones system utilities + minimal set of suckless tools (dwm with fullgaps patch + st + dmenu).

**How to run it?**

./installer.sh

**How to change it?**

However you like... It's free software so use it as you please!

Script structure easily allows adding your own modules and modifying existing ones.

**What do all these files do?**

*aur* - list of AUR git repos

*essentials* - list of essential official arch packages for creating a small and functional system

*installer.sh* - main script that makes all the changes to the system

*configs* - directory for all the config files that are copied or compiled in the installation process
